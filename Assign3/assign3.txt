Suppose a company has offices in several locations and is keen on monitoring 
the weather at those locations. They're asked us to create an application that
displays the high, low, current temperature, and condition (showers, hail, etc.) for each location. 

The information needs to be displayed in the following format:

State     City      High      Low     Current Condition

The rows are sorted based on the state and for each state, they are sorted on 
the city name.

They also want to see the name of the city with the highest temperature among 
the cities and the city with the lowest temperature.

We can fetch the temperature information from Yahoo service at URL:
http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=WOEID&u=f

where WOEID is a number like 2391102.

We can find the woeid of a city by visiting http://weather.yahoo.com using a 
browser and entering a city name. We can also find some information about the
response format at <http://developer.yahoo.com/weather>.

The program should read a bunch of WOEIDs from a file (create a sample file 
with at least 25 WOEIDs) and display information for those cities represented 
by the given WOEIDs.

Write two versions of the program (reuse as much code between the versions as possible). The first version simply reads the file, goes out to Yahoo for one WOEID at a time, and gathers data, processes the information, and displays. Make the second version much faster than the first version.

When we run the program, it should report the time (in seconds) it took to 
run, for each version. Don't include the print time in the time calculation.

Use an OO language of your choice from Java/C#/C++/Ruby to implement this application.
