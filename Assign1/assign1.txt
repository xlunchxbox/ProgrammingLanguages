Given the names (as example, write the functions so it can take any list of names):

"Amar", "Ananta", "Camilo", "Christopher", "Cody", "Dylan", "Hieu", "Jesus", "Jose", "Joseph", "Josue", "Kayla", "Mary", "Michael", "Oscar", "Owais", "Ryan", "Suman", "Varun", "Venkat", "Wei"

write a program to 

1. Using mutability and imperative style, compute the average number of letters in the names.

2. Using mutability and imperative style, compute the number of names starting  with each letter (don't include a letter if no name stars with it).

3. Using full immutability and functional style, compute the average number of letters in the names.

4. Using full immutability and functional style, compute the number of names starting with each letter (don't include a letter if no name stars with it).

Keep the printing of the results separate from the code that does the actual work.

Use two different languages (one for 1 and 2 and another for 3 and 4).
Start small, one problem at a time, and ask for frequent reviews.

Include a run command (.sh file or a .cmd file) that will compile (if necessary) and run the code samples. Keep the code in separate files with appropriate language extensions.
